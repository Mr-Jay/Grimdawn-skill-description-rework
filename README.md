# Grimdawn-skill-description-rework
Here is a wok in progress to rework the skills description for the game grimdawn. I used chatgpt to bulk work on it, but i cannot guarentee is full accuracy, it's why i'm providing this repository to allow community to finetune the description

Tutorial:

Download the tag_skills.txt here:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YvFrNMbl2xm3DqhBP0D8o3WRXxIkYy2/view?usp=sharing

On Windows, go in "C:\Users\000\Documents\My Games\Grim Dawn\Settings"
Create a folder "text_en"
Paste the file inside the folder
Play and enjoy.

Important information, i used chatGPt to help me rewrite the descriptions, i checked the accuracy with skills that i know, but i cannot confirm that all description are accurate, so if you find skills with wrong description, please share it here, so we can improve the file together.

Here is an example for few arcanist skills:

tagClass05SkillName01A=Panetti's Replicating Missile
tagClass05SkillDescription01A=Fires a magic missile that splits on impact, hitting multiple enemies.
tagClass05SkillName01B=Distortion
tagClass05SkillDescription01B=Missiles can pass through targets, allowing multi-target hits.
tagClass05SkillName01C=Supercharged
tagClass05SkillDescription01C=Adds lightning damage to the replicating missile.
tagClass05SkillName01D=Proliferation
tagClass05SkillDescription01D=Creates more projectiles on impact for wider area coverage.
tagClass05SkillName01E=Concussive Missile
tagClass05SkillDescription01E=Adds physical and aether damage to the missile impact.
I only replaced the skills part, no items, or other description.

This is only valid for 1.2.1.3 version, i cannot confirm that future updates will be compatible with these skills list descriptions.

You can open the file with a basic text editor to double-check the file.

I'm sure it would be possible to create a way to make it more consistent for the future, probably making a google sheet with name and description, and making it generate the part to replace in the file, to easily add/replace descriptions. And to make it as a mod available on nexus mod. But i have no knowledge on modding.
